The message flow, which is driven using HTTP data, is initially used to transform between XML and JSON using the new Tree Transform node. The flow is then extended to use a new Context tree which is shown using a Trace node. In the next stage of the tutorial a Jira Request node is added to the message flow which demonstrates how Context trees can help with mapping tasks. Finally a Compute node is inserted into the message flow and the new ESQL content-assist feature is used to map from a new Context tree back into a traditional logical message tree."
